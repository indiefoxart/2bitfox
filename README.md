### Hey!

This is my personal github, to keep my personal projects seperate from what I've done for professional or college work.

I'm an adult developer and artist. My primary personal work involves game development and mod development, alongside working with MCCs public API!

My main programming languages are PHP, Java, Python, and C#.
