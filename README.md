### Hey!

This is my personal github, to keep my personal projects seperate from what I've done for professional or college work.

You can call me Fox, I'm an adult developer and artist. My primary personal work involves game development and mod development, alongside working with MCCs public API!

My main programming languages are Java, Python, and C#.

You can also find me on my [Personal Site](https://empiressmp.gay/), [fansite](http://scarian.gay/), [tumblr (main)](https://gay.mcyt.xyz/), [tumblr (art)](https://mcyt.xyz/), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/2bitfox) (i don't use twitter), and [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3NzDVyocSz-qnH5hF-zg-A)
