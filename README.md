### Hey!

This is my personal github, to keep my personal projects seperate from what I've done for professional or college work.

You can call me Fox, I'm a 22 year old developer and artist. My primary personal work involves game development and mod development, alongside working with MCC's public API!

My main programming languages are Java, Python, and C#.

You can also find me on my [Personal Site](https://empiressmp.gay/), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/2bitfox), and [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3NzDVyocSz-qnH5hF-zg-A)
